# peckgame

A simple typing game in a windows form, created in Visual Studios and written in C#.

Right now, it will load a windows desktop application called "Peck."
you click the start button, and a word should appear with a textbox.
Typing the word into the textbox will erase the word letter by letter
until you've typed the whole word.
Typing the wrong letter will not erase the word, nor will it let you go to the next word.
You have to type the word originally displayed in order to advance to the next word.
There is a word counter for displaying the number of words correctly typed.
